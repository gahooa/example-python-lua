# example-python-lua
An example of embedding lua in python

## Setup:

The code is held in `main.py` though this can be adjusted in `Dockerfile`.  To run the project:

`./run`

To get an interactive python shell

`./run python`

Any args you pass to `Dockerfile.run` will be forwarded to the `docker run` command.
